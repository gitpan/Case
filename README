Case version 0.0.1
==================

This is a lightweight, pure-Perl implementation of dispatch tables
for switch-like behavior. Unlike Switch, it does not introduce new
syntax. Instead, you call a function with all your cases and actions,
and get a dispatcher (coderef) back. You pass the terms you want to
test to the dispatcher and it will take the appropriate action.
